How to write a Custom Maven Plugin Tutorial (Java FXML Scanner)

Ever wonder how to create your own Maven 3 Plugin? This tutorial
goes right to the point and shows you how develop your own custom Maven 3 plugin
in under 15 minutes. 

We'll cover building a @Mojo which scans your projects
resource path and auto-generate (during the maven GENERATE_SOURCES phase)
Java code based on some customizations offered by the plugin to the end user.

You'll learn how to simply ask for what you want in your @Mojo 
via dependency injection annotations
